I had a decently paid job, was able to do whatever I wanted, no boss around to tell me what to do or not to do, complete and total freedom. If I wanted, I could have sit around and watched youtube videos all day. Of course I did not do that, but theoretically nobody would have noticed for a month.

So why did I leave this perfect job?

## More than just money
I was not learning anything new. I was standing still. I felt like the more time passed, the more I developed backwards and the less value I would have on the market, because I would forget more and more what I learned before. This got me afraid of the future. If i did not act now, where would I be in one year? Or two years? Or five years? While others would then have 5 years of learning experiences, I would only have 5 years worth of money. And what good is that? I mean sure, first and foremost money means survival. But I believe there should be something beyond that. Afterall employees are trading their time 

## Does anyone even care?
My work was not appreciated at all. It did not matter what I was doing. It did not matter if I did a particularly good job, or would waste my time on a project that had no future. Certainly there are people out there who would not mind, as long as they get paid. Some people don't even care about the quality of their own work because as long as they get paid, it does not matter. This is fine of course and I don't judge. But personally I want to know that the life time that I'm trading in for money is actually generating worth besides that. I'm the kind of person who cares about the work I do, and I'm someone who wants to improve the environment I'm in. For example: In my previous company I was working in Europe, but collaborated with engineers in China. One of the most annoying issues was communication, as whatsapp, Slack and other "western" tools would not work well in China due to an "unstable internet connection". So I went ahead and set up our own chat server with open-source software, that ran really well for employees in Europe and China. But nobody else cared. 10% of the people ended up giving it a try, only 5 in total stayed and kept using it. For a company with over a hundred employees, this is nothing.

## I don't want to fix your broken stuff
For most of the time I was in charge of fixing problems other people caused. Sloppy engineering work in software or hardware shows at some point, that's just how it is. And then the heads would turn towards me and my buddies to find a solution. Occasionally I don't mind doing this. But after months, or even years I just can't stand it. Especially because in this example most of the problems were caused by people being careless or not just giving a damn. "Move fast and break things" was taken too literarilly by some people. Worst company slogan ever, by the way.

## Should have listened to my gut
Most importantly, I had a bad feeling about this work place from the first week when I started there. I liked my local colleagues, which is a huge reason why I stayed. But the work and the office felt somehow "off". But I stayed, thinking that I am not a quitter. In hindsight I would like to tell my earlier self to just run and leave this place behind. Strong negative feelings on the first day already area an important sign that should not be ignored. My job before this one was fun but not really paid well. Then I traded the fun job in for more cash. I believe that not being brave enough to resign in the first few weeks or months of starting this new job was one of the biggest mistakes I made in my adulthood. And it's 100% on me. There is noone else to blame. Money gives you this false justification that something is worth it. To some degree it miht be true. But personally I learned, that I still need to stand behind what I am doing day in day out. After all this is how most of us spend a big chunk of their live.
