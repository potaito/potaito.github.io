I had a decently paid job, was able to do whatever I wanted, no boss around to tell me what to do or not to do, complete and total freedom. If I wanted, I could have sit around and watched youtube videos all day. Of course I did not do that, I always kept going, but theoretically nobody would have noticed if I stopped for a few weeks.

So why did I leave this "perfect" job?

## Deviation from my plans
Before accepting this job, I was a lab assistant at the university. And because of my own insecurities, I have been contemplating whether to start a PhD or not for almost a year. My impression was, that in order to do a PhD, one would have to stand 100% behind it. How else would can someone surive 4-6 years of tight deadlines, often working until late at night and coming up with brilliant research ideas? That was at least my own definition of a PhD, and why I was reluctant to make the jump.

One day I was contacted by a friend working at this really interesting company, because they needed someone with my qualities apparently. I almost convinced myself to finally start a PhD, so I rejected my friend and his offer. But he asked two more times a bit later, and ultimately I was lured in by a 50% higher salary compared to what I was earning as a lab assistant, and false expectations. Most notably I was assuming I would be doing applied research, so basically what PhD students do, but with a higher salary. Obviously I was wrong and doing research at a company will probably always be completely different than doing research at a university. So I accepted the job.

## More than just money
Fast forward three years. I was not learning anything new and felt like I was standing still. The more time passed, the more I developed backwards and the less value I would have on the market, because I would forget more and more what I learned before. This got me afraid of my own future. If i did not act now, where would I be in one year? Or two years? Or five years? While others would then have 5 years of learning experiences, I would only have 5 years worth of money. And what good is that? I mean sure, first and foremost money means survival. But I believe there should be something beyond that. Afterall, as employees we are giving someone our time and energy, who then hopefully does something good with it. 

## Does anyone even care?
My work was not appreciated at all. It did not matter what I was doing for most of the time. Therefore it also did not matter if I did a particularly good job, or would waste my time on a project that had no future. Certainly there are other people out there who would not mind this fact, as long as they get paid. Some don't even care about the quality of their own work, as long as nobody complains. This is fine of course and I don't judge. But personally I want to know that my life's time and energy that I'm investing (in return for money, yes) is actually generating worth besides that. I'm the kind of person who cares about what I do, and I'm someone who wants to improve the environment I exist in. If the structure of the work place prevents me from making such changes, or even raising ideas, I'm going to stop developing new ideas. And ultimately my personal nature will change as I actively prevent myself from thinking outside of my own work's scope. And that's sad, because many employers are particularly interested in people who "think outside the box". But in my case at some point I jumped into the box, flipped it over and stayed in there.

## I don't want to fix broken stuff all day long
Another aspect that bothered me is that for most of the time I was in charge of fixing problems other people caused. And the reasons were more often than not sloppy engineering work done by others. I don't mind occasioanlly fixing other people's problems. not at all But after months, or even years I just could not stand it anymore. Especially because in my example most of these problems were caused by people being careless and thinking, that their solutions were "good enough". So on one side there were the engineers in this company who would quickly develop new solutions with little care for how maintable they would be, or how easily they would break. And on the other side there was I, with my local colleagues, who were mostly running after them with a broom, cleaning up the mess.

"Move fast and break things" was taken too literarilly. Worst company slogan ever, by the way. As always in life it's necessary to find a compromise. In this case the compromise consists of perfectionism, which makes us too slow, and being careless and moving fast.

## Should have listened to my gut
The most important personal lesson: I had a bad feeling about the new job from the first week when I started there. I liked my colleagues, which is a huge reason why I stayed. But the work and the office felt somehow "off". Most likely because I ditched my original plans to do a PhD and had therefore high expectations to make it worth it. I stayed regardless of the bad gut feeling, thinking that "I am not a quitter". In hindsight I would like to tell my earlier self to just run and leave this place behind if it feels wrong. Strong negative feelings on the first day are an important sign that should not be ignored.

And to be honest, my lower paying job before this one was really fun. I never had to look at the clock and check how much longer I would have to stay before I would able to go home. I traded this fun job in for more cash. And I believe that not being brave enough to accept that I made a mistake and resign in the first few months of starting at the new place was a big mistake that I made. And it's 100% on me. There is noone else to blame.

Money can give us this false justification that something is worth it. To some degree it might be true. But personally I learned, that I still need to stand behind what I am doing day in day out. After all, work is how most of us spend a big chunk of their live.
