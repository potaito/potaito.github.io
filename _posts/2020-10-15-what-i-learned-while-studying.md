- Good and bad habits: I had to study at ETH because the environment was right. No distraction at library. Only job to do there is to study. Reward: Go socialize, go to the gym or work on a fun private project like a website or something.

- Allocating time: Day has only so many hours, and a week has only so many days. I stopped going to lectures that gave me nothing in return and would learn on my own. Sometimes I also had to sacrifice work for certain lectures when I knew, that I had done the important 80%, while in some other task I was nowhere yet.

- Tackling new problems: In almost every lecture I ran into problems right from the beginning. The theory was difficult, I would lack the math skills (or so I would believe) etc. Over time I got used to this and was no longer thrown off track when encountering a problem. Actually, I started to expect problems in everything I do. I was sure it would not be easy. This way I was often right, and sometimes pleasently surprised when it was in fact easy. This is opposed to being constantly disappointed by oneself for seemingly failing at some tasks.

- Collaborate with competitors: The harsh reality is, that universities often grade by adjusting the curve such that a specific percentile fails or passes. With hundreds of students, professors and teaching staff cannot know each individual and grade on a personal level. And with hundreds of students it's possible to grade based on statistical measures. The problem for students is, that technically every other student is competition. Other students being very good in something would mean, that I myself would have worse odds to pass the same tests as them. However, studying at a unverisity is very difficuly to begin with, and it's in my opinion absolutely necessary to cooperate with others. This can be exchange of information, or letting someone know of important short-term changes etc. I learned, that even though other students are the competition, I'm far better off by cooperating and being social, as this would give everyone the same chance. There were a few students who tried to only consume from others, but never give something in return. These students became known quickly for thei behaviour. As a result, others did not trust them and only few shared information with these individuals, since they were suspect.

- I learned less about engineering than I expected. At the same time I also gained knowledge about things that I did not even know existed before I studied.

- During my master studies I started to connect the dots more and more, and I started to actually understand theory at heart which a few years before I would never have thought would be possible.
